 ðŸŽ® Word Shooter â€“ A 2D Vocabulary Shooting Game (C++ + OpenGL) Word Shooter is a fast-paced 2D game built from scratch in C++ using OpenGL, designed as a Programming Fundamentals course project. The player shoots alphabets onto a dynamic grid to form valid English words â€” horizontally, vertically, or diagonally â€” within a 2-minute timer.  ðŸ”¹ Key Features: Randomized board with letter tiles   Mouse-based letter shooting logic   Real-time word detection using a dictionary of 370,000+ words   Words are burst and points awarded based on length   Tile-based board system (22x31 grid)   Built-in timer and Game Over status screen    ðŸ”§ Technologies Used: C++   OpenGL (GLUT, GLEW)   Makefile for build automation   Linux (Ubuntu)    ðŸ§  Concepts Applied: 2D rendering, game loops, and user interaction   Data structures (arrays, strings)   Collision detection, grid logic, and animation   Event-driven programming and display refresh cycles   Compatible with Linux (Ubuntu); OpenGL dependencies required.  ðŸ“Œ Note: This project was developed as a learning experience and showcases beginner-to-intermediate programming skills in graphics and logic. Contributions or forks are welcome for educational use.
